# Elephant_Candle_Finder

The provided code is a trading strategy written in the programming language of ThinkOrSwim Plataform.

The strategy aims to identify bullish and bearish "elephant" candles, which are candles with larger ranges compared to previous candles. The code takes into account the high, low, open, and close prices of each candle, as well as user-defined inputs for the number of previous candles to consider (velasant) and the multiple by which the range of the elephant candle should be larger compared to previous candles (elefantesize).

The code assigns colors (yellow for bullish and magenta for bearish) to the elephant candles on the price chart and provides sound and program alerts when such candles are identified. The code also includes a chart bubble with additional information about the range of the current candle and the highest range of the previous candles.

Overall, the code is designed to help traders visually identify potential bullish and bearish elephant candles on price charts and receive alerts for potential trading opportunities. It is likely intended for use by traders who are knowledgeable about trading concepts and familiar with the ThinkOrSwim platform
